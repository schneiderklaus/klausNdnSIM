# topo-multipath.txt

# any empty lines and lines starting with '#' symbol is ignored
#
# The file should contain exactly two sections: router and link, each starting with the corresponding keyword
#
# router section defines topology nodes and their relative positions (e.g., to use in visualizer)
router

# each line in this section represents one router and should have the following data
# node  comment     yPos    xPos
client    NA          2       1
router1   NA          1       2
router2   NA          2       2
router3   NA		  3 	  2
backbone  NA          2       3
server    NA          2       4
# Note that `node` can be any string. It is possible to access to the node by name using Names::Find, see examples.

# link section defines point-to-point links between nodes and characteristics of these links
link

# Each line should be in the following format (only first two are required, the rest can be omitted)
# srcNode   dstNode     bandwidth   metric  delay   queue
# bandwidth: link bandwidth
# metric: routing metric // Set real routing metrics inside simulation file! 
# delay:  link delay
# queue:  MaxPackets for transmission queue on the link (both directions)
